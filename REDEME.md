# VisualData

@(JavaScript)[BootStrap|E-Charts]

###Introduction
This program is based on our **Term Project** last semester (in 11/2018), the topic of which given by the professor is "Social network analysis and data visualization".
- **Objective** ：To analyze and visualize a data collection composed of posts and comments. It is an extract from Reddit which is part of the e-Risk evaluation campaign. The full data set is composed of 10 temporal chunks, each containing 10% of each user’s textual posts. In each chunk, every user is annotated as depressed or non-depressed. The project objective is to develop an interface that allows to visualize the data.
-  **The first part of this project** ：Extracting and analyzing different features from the raw data, using python and R.
- **The second part of this project** ：Using any language to visualize the data we got from the first step. Here I used the HTML, CSS, Javascript and E-charts ( a data visualization js library) to represent the data in this program named *VisualData*. Although as you can see, the code of this program is pretty simple.



####Characteristics of this program:
- **Simple to code, easy to understand:** It is simple to code with the framework Bootstrap and the powerful library E-Charts which is based on JavaScript.
- **Well-designed layout and Interface:** Visualize in a comfortable  way, aiming at the first sight, one-page data visualization.
- **Good compatibility :** Low version IE, mobile devices, (with node-canvas) Server Render.
- **Deep Interaction:** Legends, visual mapping, data area scaling, tooltip,
data filtering, and other interactive components.
